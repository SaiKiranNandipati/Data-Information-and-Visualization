# Data Insights Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on visualizing diverse datasets through five distinct types of visualizations. Each visualization is designed to provide unique insights and enable informed decision-making for users. By leveraging tools like **D3.js**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, this dashboard offers an interactive and intuitive experience for exploring complex datasets.

## Visualizations
1. **Regression Line Visualizer**:
   - Allows users to plot points on a grid interactively.
   - Computes and displays a regression line using the least squares method.
   - Features include adding, removing, and resetting points for hands-on exploration.

2. **Performance Comparison Between Two Funds**:
   - Visualizes trends for selected financial funds over customizable time periods.
   - Enables dropdown fund selection and interactive hover details.

3. **Collapsible Tree for GitHub Repository Structure**:
   - Illustrates the folder hierarchy of any GitHub repository.
   - Supports user interaction to expand/collapse directories and fetch new data dynamically using the GitHub API.

4. **100% Stacked Bar Chart for Browser Market Share**:
   - Represents browser market share trends from 2009 to 2024.
   - Includes interactive tooltips for detailed data exploration.

5. **Density Plot for African Country-wise COVID-19 Cases**:
   - Visualizes COVID-19 cases per million people across African countries.
   - Features a date slider to explore temporal trends and hover tooltips for country-specific details.

## Tools and Technologies
- **D3.js**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS**: For building and styling the dashboard.
- **Node.js**: Backend support for some visualizations.
- **GeoJSON & CSV**: Data handling for map and chart visualizations.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Each plot offers unique interactive elements like dropdowns, sliders, and hover details.
- **Real-time Updates**: Visualizations dynamically adapt based on user inputs.
- **Intuitive User Experience**: Designed for easy navigation and data exploration.

## Project Goals
- Provide tools to visualize datasets effectively.
- Enable users to extract actionable insights through interactive dashboards.
- Demonstrate the power of visualizations in understanding data relationships and trends.
